# About {.unnumbered}

The Climate Knowledge Graph (CKG) is a project to make a _knowledge graph_ of the open access parts of the 10,000 page [*IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)*](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/) corpus.

## Goal

The goal is to enable easier knowledge use from complex document corpus by: 

1. Making corpus search results available as multi-format publications, and 
2. enabling corpus data analysis by providing FAIR linked open data resources.

CKG uses open-source software and can be used on any document corpus.
