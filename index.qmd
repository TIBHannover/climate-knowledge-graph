# About 🌏🌍🌎 {.unnumbered}

Project status: Pre-release. Alpha Knowledge graph ETA end of Q4 2025. (Updated Sept. '25)

The Climate Knowledge Graph (CKG) is an R&D project to make a _knowledge graph_ of the open access parts of the 10,000 page [*IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)*](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/) corpus.

Git repo: [CKG](https://github.com/TIBHannover/climate-knowledge-graph)

## Goal 🥨

The goal is to enable easier knowledge use from complex document corpus by: 

1. Making corpus search results available as multi-format publications, and 
2. enabling corpus data analysis by providing FAIR linked open data resources.

CKG uses open-source software and can be used on any document corpus.
