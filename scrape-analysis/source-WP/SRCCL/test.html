                            <strong>Many land-related responses that contribute to climate change adaptation and
                                mitigation can also combat desertification and land degradation and enhance food
                                security. The potential for land-related responses and the relative emphasis on
                                adaptation and mitigation is context specific, including the adaptive capacities of
                                communities and regions. While land-related response options can make important
                                contributions to adaptation and mitigation, there are some barriers to adaptation and
                                limits to their contribution to global mitigation. (<em>very high confidence</em>)

                            Some land-related actions are already being taken that contribute to climate change
                            adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development. The response options were assessed
                            across adaptation, mitigation, combating desertification and land degradation, food security
                            and sustainable development, and a select set of options deliver across all of these
                            challenges. These options include, but are not limited to, sustainable food production,
                            improved and sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem
                            conservation and land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food
                            loss and waste (<em>high confidence</em>). These response options require integration of
                            biophysical, socioeconomic and other enabling factors. {6.3, 6.4.5, 7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box

                            While some response options have immediate impacts, others take decades to deliver
                            measurable results. Examples of response options with immediate impacts include the
                            conservation of high-carbon ecosystems such as peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, mangroves
                            and forests. Examples that provide multiple ecosystem services and functions, but take more
                            time to deliver, include afforestation and reforestation as well as the restoration of
                            high-carbon ecosystems, agroforestry, and the reclamation of degraded soils (<em>high</em>
                            <em>confidence</em>). {6.4.5, 7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}</p>

                            The successful implementation of response options depends on consideration of local
                            environmental and socio-economic conditions. Some options such as soil carbon management are
                            potentially applicable across a broad range of land use types, whereas the efficacy of land
                            management practices relating to organic soils, peatlands and wetlands, and those linked to
                            freshwater resources, depends on specific agro-ecological conditions (<em>high</em>
                            <em>confidence</em>). Given the site-specific nature of climate change impacts on food
                            system components and wide variations in agroecosystems, adaptation and mitigation options
                            and their barriers are linked to environmental and cultural context at regional and local
                            levels (<em>high</em> <em>confidence</em>). Achieving land degradation neutrality depends on
                            the integration of multiple responses across local, regional and national scales and across
                            multiple sectors including agriculture, pasture, forest and water (<em>high

                            Land-based options that deliver carbon sequestration in soil or vegetation, such as
                            afforestation, reforestation, agroforestry, soil carbon management on mineral soils, or
                            carbon storage in harvested wood products, do not continue to sequester carbon indefinitely
                            (<em>high confidence</em>). Peatlands, however, can continue to sequester carbon for
                            centuries (<em>high confidence</em>). When vegetation matures or when vegetation and soil
                            carbon reservoirs reach saturation, the annual removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere
                            declines towards zero, while carbon stocks can be maintained (<em>high confidence</em>).
                            However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss (or sink
                            reversal) triggered by disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or
                            future poor management (<em>high confidence</em>). {6.4.1}</p>

                            <strong>Most of the response options assessed contribute positively to sustainable
                                development and other societal goals (<em>high confidence</em>). Many response options
                                can be applied without competing for land and have the potential to provide multiple
                                co-benefits (<em>high confidence</em>). A further set of response options has the
                                potential to reduce demand for land, thereby enhancing the potential for other response
                                options to deliver across each of climate change adaptation and mitigation, combating
                                desertification and land degradation, and enhancing food security (<em>high
                                    confidence</em>). (Figure SPM.3) {4.8, 6.2, 6.3.6, 6.4.3}</strong>

                            A number of land management options, such as improved management of cropland and grazing
                            lands, improved and sustainable forest management, and increased soil organic carbon
                            content, do not require land use change and do not create demand for more land conversion
                            (<em>high confidence</em>). Further, a number of response options such as increased food
                            productivity, dietary choices and food losses, and waste reduction, can reduce demand for
                            land conversion, thereby potentially freeing land and creating opportunities for enhanced
                            implementation of other response options (<em>high confidence</em>). Response options that
                            reduce competition for land are possible and are applicable at different scales, from farm

                            A wide range of adaptation and mitigation responses, e.g., preserving and restoring natural
                            ecosystems such as peatland, coastal lands and forests, biodiversity conservation, reducing
                            competition for land, fire management, soil management, and most risk management options
                            (e.g., use of local seeds, disaster risk management, risk sharing instruments) have the
                            potential to make positive contributions to sustainable development, enhancement of

                            Ecosystem-based adaptation can, in some contexts, promote nature conservation while
                            alleviating poverty and can even provide co-benefits by removing GHGs and protecting
                            livelihoods (e.g., mangroves) (<em>medium confidence</em>). {6.4.3, 7.4.6.2}</p>

                            Most of the land management-based response options that do not increase competition for
                            land, and almost all options based on value chain management (e.g., dietary choices, reduced
                            post-harvest losses, reduced food waste) and risk management, can contribute to eradicating
                            poverty and eliminating hunger while promoting good health and wellbeing, clean water and

                            <strong>Although most response options can be applied without competing for available land,
                                some can increase demand for land conversion (<em>high confidence</em>). At the
                                deployment scale of several GtCO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>, this increased demand for

                            wetlands affect smaller land areas globally, and the impacts on land use change of these

                            While land can make a valuable contribution to climate change mitigation, there are limits
                            to the deployment of land-based mitigation measures such as bioenergy crops or
                            afforestation. Widespread use at the scale of several millions of km<sup>2</sup> globally
                            could increase risks for desertification, land degradation, food security and sustainable
                            development (<em>medium confidence</em>). Applied on a limited share of total land,
                            land-based mitigation measures that displace other land uses have fewer adverse side-effects
                            and can have positive co-benefits for adaptation, desertification, land degradation or food

                            The production and use of biomass for bioenergy can have co-benefits, adverse side-effects,
                            and risks for land degradation, food insecurity, GHG emissions and other environmental and
                            sustainable development goals (<em>high confidence</em>). These impacts are context specific
                            and depend on the scale of deployment, initial land use, land type, bioenergy feedstock,
                            initial carbon stocks, climatic region and management regime, and other land-demanding
                            response options can have a similar range of consequences (<em>high confidence</em>). The
                            use of residues and organic waste as bioenergy feedstock can mitigate land use change
                            pressures associated with bioenergy deployment, but residues are limited and the removal of
                            residues that would otherwise be left on the soil could lead to soil degradation (<em>high

                            The land area needed for bioenergy in modelled pathways varies significantly depending on
                            the socio-economic pathway, the warming level, and the feedstock and production system used
                            (<em>high confidence</em>). Modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5&#176;C use up
                            to 7 million km<sup>2</sup> for bioenergy in 2050; bioenergy land area is smaller in
                            2&#176;C (0.4 to 5 million km<sup>2</sup>) and 3&#176;C pathways (0.1 to 3 million
                            km<sup>2</sup>) (<em>medium confidence</em>). Pathways with large levels of land conversion
                            may imply adverse side-effects impacting water scarcity, biodiversity, land degradation,
                            desertification, and food security, if not adequately and carefully managed, whereas best
                            practice implementation at appropriate scales can have co-benefits, such as management of
                            dryland salinity, enhanced biocontrol and biodiversity and enhancing soil carbon
                            sequestration (<em>high confidence</em>). (Figure SPM.3) {2.6, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2, Cross-Chapter

                            Most mitigation pathways include substantial deployment of bioenergy technologies. A small
                            number of modelled pathways limit warming to 1.5&#186;C with reduced dependence on bioenergy
                            and BECCS (land area below &lt;1 million km<sup>2</sup> in 2050) and other carbon dioxide
                            removal (CDR) options (<em>high confidence</em>). These pathways have even more reliance on
                            rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban systems and infrastructure, and on
                            behavioural and lifestyle changes compared to other 1.5&#176;C pathways. {2.6.2, 5.5.1, 6.4,
                            Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}</p>
                        <p>B.7.5<br>
                            These modelled pathways do not consider the effects of climate change on land or
                            CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation. In addition, these pathways include only a subset of the
                            response options assessed in this report (<em>high confidence</em>); the inclusion of
                            additional response options in models could reduce the projected need for bioenergy or CDR
                            that increases the demand for land. {6.4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}</p>

                                <p>This Figure is based on an aggregation of information from studies with a wide
                                    variety of assumptions about how response options are implemented and the contexts
                                    in which they occur. Response options implemented differently at local to global
                                    scales could lead to different outcomes. <b>Magnitude of potential:</b> For panel A,
                                    magnitudes are for the technical potential of response options globally. For each
                                    land challenge, magnitudes are set relative to a marker level as follows. For
                                    mitigation, potentials are set relative to the approximate potentials for the
                                    response options with the largest individual impacts (~3 GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq
                                    yr<sup>-1</sup>). The threshold for the &#8216;large&#8217; magnitude category is
                                    set at this level. For adaptation, magnitudes are set relative to the 100 million
                                    lives estimated to be affected by climate change and a carbon-based economy between
                                    2010 and 2030. The threshold for the &#8216;large&#8217; magnitude category
                                    represents 25% of this total. For desertification and land degradation, magnitudes
                                    are set relative to the lower end of current estimates of degraded land, 10&#8211;60
                                    million km<sup>2</sup>. The threshold for the &#8216;large&#8217; magnitude category
                                    represents 30% of the lower estimate. For food security, magnitudes are set relative
                                    to the approximately 800 million people who are currently undernourished. The
                                    threshold for the &#8216;large&#8217; magnitude category represents 12.5% of this
                                    total. For panel B, for the first row (high level implementation) for each response
                                    option, the magnitude and thresholds are as defined for panel A. In the second row
                                    (best practice implementation) for each response option, the qualitative assessments
                                    that are green denote potential positive impacts, and those shown in grey indicate
                                    neutral interactions. Increased food production is assumed to be achieved through
                                    sustainable intensification rather than through injudicious application of
                                    additional external inputs such as agrochemicals. <b>Levels of confidence:</b>
                                    Confidence in the magnitude category (high, medium or low) into which each option
                                    falls for mitigation, adaptation, combating desertification and land degradation,
                                    and enhancing food security. High confidence means that there is a high level of
                                    agreement and evidence in the literature to support the categorisation as high,
                                    medium or low magnitude. Low confidence denotes that the categorisation of magnitude
                                    is based on few studies. Medium confidence reflects medium evidence and agreement in
                                    the magnitude of response. <b>Cost ranges:</b> Cost estimates are based on
                                    aggregation of often regional studies and vary in the components of costs that are
                                    included. In panel B, cost estimates are not provided for best practice
                                    implementation. One coin indicates low cost (&lt;USD10
                                    tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq<sup>-1</sup> or &lt;USD20 ha<sup>-1</sup>), two coins indicate
                                    medium cost (USD10-USD100 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq<sup>-1</sup> or USD20 &#8211;USD200
                                    ha<sup>-1</sup>), and three coins indicate high cost (&gt;USD100
                                    tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq<sup>-1</sup> or USD200 ha<sup>-1</sup>). Thresholds in USD
                                    ha<sup>-1</sup> are chosen to be comparable, but precise conversions will depend on
                                    the response option. <b>Supporting evidence: </b>Supporting evidence for the
                                    magnitude of the quantitative potential for land management-based response options
                                    can be found as follows: for mitigation Table&#8217;s 6.13 to 6.20, with further
                                    evidence in Section 2.7.1; for adaptation Table&#8217;s 6.21 to 6.28; for combating
                                    desertification Table&#8217;s 6.29 to 6.36, with further evidence in Chapter 3; for
                                    combating degradation tables 6.37 to 6.44, with further evidence in Chapter 4; for
                                    enhancing food security Table&#8217;s 6.45 to 6.52, with further evidence in Chapter
                                    5. Other synergies and trade-offs not shown here are discussed in Chapter 6.
                                    Additional supporting evidence for the qualitative assessments in the second row for
                                    each option in panel B can be found in the Table&#8217;s 6.6, 6.55, 6.56 and 6.58,
