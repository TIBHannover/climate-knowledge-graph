                                        <p>Figure 1.4 also illustrates time scales associated with different impacts.
                                            While many impacts scale with the change in GMST itself, some (such as those
                                            associated with ocean acidification) scale with the change in atmospheric
                                            CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, indicated by the fraction of cumulative
                                            CO<sub>2</sub> emissions remaining in the atmosphere (dotted lines in Figure
                                            1.4c). Others may depend on the rate of change of GMST, while
                                            &#8216;time-integrated impacts&#8217;, such as sea level rise, shown in
                                            Figure 1.4d continue to increase even after GMST has stabilised.</p>
                                        <p>Hence impacts that occur when GMST reaches 1.5&#176;C could be very different
                                            depending on the pathway to 1.5&#176;C. CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will
                                            be higher as GMST rises past 1.5&#176;C (transient warming) than when GMST
                                            has stabilized at 1.5&#176;C, while sea level and, potentially, global mean

                                            These differences could lead to very different impacts on agriculture, on
                                            some forms of extreme weather (e.g., Baker et al., 2018)<sup id="fnref:r120"

                                            ecosystems (e.g., Mitchell et al., 2017<sup id="fnref:r121"

                                            be higher still if GMST returns to 1.5&#176;C after an overshoot (Figure 1.4
                                            d), with potentially significantly different impacts in vulnerable regions.
                                            Temperature overshoot could also cause irreversible impacts (see Chapter 3).
